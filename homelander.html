          <span class="text-red">Superhuman Strength:</span><br />
          One of Homelander's primary abilities is his tremendous superhuman
          strength, being strongest man in the world according to Jonah
          Vogelbaum and Stormfront. He possesses the greatest level of strength
          ever seen, allowing him to effortlessly overpower any opponent. As a
          child, he broke a woman's spine by hugging her. After he and Queen
          Maeve intercepted a robbery, he threw the first thief far away and
          high into the air. He also embedded his fist in a shooter's torso.
          Homelander casually knocked off the door of a pressurized plane, but
          he stated he was unable to carry the hijacked plane to safety,
          suggesting that he is unable to use his full strength in flight,
          requiring a solid surface to take full advantage of his power. This
          was also seen when he was unable to stop the full weight of a falling
          bus and concrete debris brought down on top of him when he was
          hovering during his encounter with Kenji Miyashiro. He was later able
          to throw a baseball from New York to Boston and slapped Blindspot's
          head with enough force to burst his eardrums and cause excessive
          bleeding. Homelander easily overpowered Starlight and Doppelganger,
          lifting the latter off the ground and snapping his neck. He later
          contended with Stormfront and crushed a man's head in one hand.

          <span class="text-red">Laser Vision:</span><br />
          Homelander is able to generate powerful heat energy from within his
          eyes and can project them outwards as high powered energy beams. These
          blasts of energy are so powerful that they appear to be able to cut
          through anything, such as Steve's plane. He also used his heat vision
          to melt a thief's gun to the latter's hand. However, Homelander is
          most notable for using his optical beams on people, melting flesh and
          bone with ease and causing people to burst into gore. His heat vision
          can also likely cut through most supes, shown in Homelander's
          hesitation to use them on Stormfront. In "Cherry" Madelyn Stillwell
          explained his optical beams as "Two small, high-intensity beams,
          roughly the width of human eyes".

          <span class="text-red">Invulnerability:</span><br />
          Homelander seems to be immune to all forms of physical harm and is
          thereby the most resilient of the Seven, and possibly of all Supes. As
          such, he is not only completely bulletproof but is also unfazed by
          explosions, such as when Billy blew up the Stillwell residence with
          him inside it. According to Madelyn Stillwell, "There isn't a weapon
          on Earth that they haven't throw at him. They've all failed.",
          implying that he could also survive nuclear explosions. While pursuing
          Kenji Miyashiro and the Boys, Homelander survived having a bus and
          several large pieces of concrete dropped on top of him without any
          signs of injury save for being dirtied from the incident.

        <p class="section-text margin-left200">
          <span class="text-red">Flight:</span><br />
          Homelander is able to levitate and propel himself at great speeds,
          allowing him to cover vast distances in a matter of minutes. In "The
          Female of the Species" it was stated that he could reach a hi-jacked
          flight before F-16 fighter jets. Top speeds of the F-16 jets are just
          under 1,500 mph/Mach 2.

          Homelander can see through any solid object or surface, with the
          exception of objects and surfaces that are lined with zinc.

          Homelander possesses stamina that is enhanced to inhuman levels. As a
          result, his muscles produce practically no fatigue toxins during
          physical activity. They are able to withstand the stresses of moving
          at superhuman speeds or performing other superhuman feats for extended
          periods of time, without tiring or becoming weak. However, he could
          not last long with Madelyn.
