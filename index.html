              With the face of a movie star and the power of a god, Homelander
              is considered the greatest superhero alive and the leader of The
              Seven. Not only can he fly, but he also has super strength and
              super hearing, and he can see through almost anything (except
              zinc) with his x-ray vision and then destroy it with his laser
              eyes. On the surface, he’s affable, modest, and sincere; the
              ultimate Boy Scout, an American treasure, a God-fearing patriot.
              But just like mere mortals, even superheroes have secrets.

              Underneath the cavalier exterior of a celebrity superhero lies the
              soul of a mortal athlete, with a deep insecurity about staying at
              the top. He’ll do whatever it takes to remain in The Seven,
              because he knows it’s only a matter of time until a younger,
              faster challenger takes his place — and that’s a problem even the
              fastest man in the world can’t outrun.

              The Deep can breathe underwater and communicate with sea
              creatures. His attractive features have made him Vought’s social
              media propaganda. Unfortunately, that’s pretty much all the
              company wants from him — because he’s The Seven’s token aquatic
              Superhero. But he knows he could be doing so much more than
              flashing his biceps on Instagram if only they’d let him... even
              though he’s secretly proud that his profile gets 4 million hits a
              day.

              The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
              normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
              content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
              publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
              their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
              uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
              have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
              purpose (injected humour and the like).

              The persona Stormfront puts on for the public, is one of a edgy
              but virtuous and genuine all american e-girl who stands up for the
              rights of the downtrodden, and refuses to "sellout" to "the man".
              In reality, Stormfront is a malicious, bigoted and bad-tempered
              woman who is rude, sarcastic and passive aggressive to almost
              everyone she interacts with, including people she supposedly
              likes, such as Homelander. Stormfront is prone to making constant
              criticisms and insults to Vought Employees and her fellow team
              members, usually with a snarky and condescending tone. Stormfront
              appears to use her position as a superhero to commit racially
              motivated murders with impunity. These killings seem random and
              opportunistic, but predominately targeted against people of color.

              the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The

              As a warrior, a feminist, a humanitarian, and second most powerful
              member of The Seven, Queen Maeve is the ultimate role model for
              little girls all over the world. But to reach such astonishing
              heights, she’s had to make sacrifices along the way. Embracing the
              image that Vought demanded she accept meant abandoning the truths
              – and even some of the people – she held dear.Disillusioned and
              cynical, she’s now a shell of the determined idealist she once
              was.
